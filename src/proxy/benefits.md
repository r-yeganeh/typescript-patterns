The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing it to perform additional operations when the object is accessed, such as security checks, lazy initialization, logging, or managing resource-intensive operations. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to add behavior to the existing class without changing it.

Benefits of the Proxy Pattern

1. Controlled Access: You can control the access to an object with a proxy, which can add various checks or balances (like permissions or session verification) before the actual object is accessed.
2. Lazy Initialization: Delay the creation and initialization of expensive objects until needed.
   Logging and Monitoring: You can log each operation performed on the object, which is useful for debugging and auditing usage.
3. Intercepting Calls: Modify or augment the behavior of the original object when methods are called on it (for example, adding caching mechanisms).
