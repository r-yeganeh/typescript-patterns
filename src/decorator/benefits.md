The Decorator pattern in TypeScript is particularly useful when you need to dynamically add responsibilities to objects without altering their structure. This pattern is a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Common applications include enhancing or modifying the behavior of UI components, adding cross-cutting concerns like logging or security features, or any situation where you might traditionally use multiple inheritance.
