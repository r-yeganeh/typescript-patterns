The repository pattern can be defined as an abstraction over data storage, allowing the decoupling of data access logic from the business logic. The repository pattern has lots of benefits:

- It enforces the dependency inversion principle
- Since business logic and data access logic are loosely coupled, they can be tested separately
- It helps with keeping the code structured and organized
- It reduces duplication of code and enhances code maintainability
