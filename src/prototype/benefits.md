1. Deep Copying
   The spread syntax performs a shallow copy of the object. This means if your object contains nested objects or arrays, these will not be copied by value; instead, the references to these nested items are copied. Hence, changes to nested items in the copied object will affect the original object. The Prototype pattern can be tailored to perform deep copies when needed, thereby avoiding unintended shared references.
2. Encapsulation
   Using the Prototype pattern, the copying logic is encapsulated within the class itself. This encapsulation means the class controls how it should be copied, including handling any special cases specific to its internal structure. If an object requires more than just copying values (e.g., re-establishing database connections, re-registering event listeners, or other initialization tasks), this can be handled inside the clone method.

3. Customization Before Copying
   The Prototype pattern allows for more complex scenarios where some properties might need to be recalculated or reset when an object is cloned. For example, if you're cloning a session in a web application, you might want to reset timestamps or other data that should be unique to each session.

4. Polymorphism
   If your application uses polymorphism, where objects of different subclasses are managed through a common interface or superclass, the Prototype pattern can be particularly useful. Each subclass can define its own clone method adhering to a common interface, ensuring that objects are cloned correctly regardless of their concrete class.
