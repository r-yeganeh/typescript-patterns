The Strategy pattern is a design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. It is particularly useful when you have several different algorithms or business rules that need to be selected dynamically during runtime depending on the context or configuration.
