The Template Method pattern is a fundamental design pattern in TypeScript (and other object-oriented languages) that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. It is particularly useful when multiple classes share a common process with slight variations in the execution of certain steps.
