The Composite pattern is an essential design pattern in TypeScript when you need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful for creating tree-like structures where you need to work with the components through a common interface. Itâ€™s frequently used in scenarios involving graphical user interfaces, file systems, and anywhere you have a hierarchical structure of objects.

Benefits of the Composite Pattern
Uniformity: Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
Simplicity: Simplifies client code, as it can treat composite structures and individual objects the same.
Flexibility: Makes it easier to add new types of components as long as they implement the same interface.
This pattern is crucial when the distinction between individual objects and compositions of objects must be ignored from a client's perspective. It simplifies the client interface and supports the dynamic addition or removal of components through the common interface.
