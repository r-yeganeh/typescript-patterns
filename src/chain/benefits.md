The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern is particularly useful when multiple objects can handle a request, but the handler doesnâ€™t have to be a specific object in advance. It's often used in processing events, handling user interface actions, or implementing logging frameworks where various loggers can handle different levels of logging messages.
