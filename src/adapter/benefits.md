The Adapter pattern is especially useful in TypeScript when you need to make two incompatible interfaces work together without modifying their existing code. This pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, translating or converting data from one interface to another. Common scenarios include integrating new software components with legacy systems, working with third-party or external libraries, and handling data from different sources in a uniform manner.
